Solar miner controler

Features:
 - Activation of Sonoff smartswitches
 - Management of Antminer Mining frequency
 - Grid Imported energy data reading from Solax solar inverter.


Control loop will reduce the mining frequency when imported energy is greater than 0W.

Control loop will switch off the miners controlling the sonoff smartwitches when the solar arrays have very low
voltage.
